#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

In **Stage One**, I take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

In **Stage Two**, I implemented a cache DB to store data localy on PWA.

In **Stage Three**, I improved the offline function of this PWA. With this step user can add him review both online and offline. User also can check him favorite restaurants.

### Specification

To run the project, you need to build the `dist` directory. In this folder, run:

1. `npm install`.
2. `grunt`, to build the responsive images.
3. `gulp`, to build the project.
